Git pull, in a nutshell, is a two-part process.
First, your remote-tracking branch is synced with the “true” branch in the remote repository.

Then, your local branch is compared to the remote-tracking branch
and receives the new commits so it can catch up to the current state of the remote branch


The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. 
It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, 
pushing exports commits to remote branches.
